#Guardian Spirit
The cycle of life begins with light, nurtured by the earth, touched by the moon’s phases, and fueled by fire’s warmth.\nSeek the order that mirrors the dawn of creation.
#The Spirit of the Priest
In the darkness, the truth waits for the one who dares to see.\nLook beyond the obvious, for only the symbol that peers into the unseen will reveal what is hidden.
#The Keeper of the Depths
The first to move is swift and playful. The second waits, patient and watchful. The third is slow and steady. The last drifts peacefully in the depths.
