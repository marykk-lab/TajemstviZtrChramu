#Trap Room
Sometimes the simplest path is the right one. The first step is where it all begins, the second follows, and the third brings you closer to your goal.\nTrust the natural order.
#Reliquary
The chest of gold gleams with a promise, but its true value lies in its purity. The others may hold power, but they are shackled by their own nature.\nOnly the golden one will reveal what is lost.
